# Python Operators
## 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Used for mathematical operations.
```
+   # Addition: a + b
-   # Subtraction: a - b
*   # Multiplication: a * b
/   # Division: a / b
%   # Modulus (remainder): a % b
**  # Exponentiation (power): a ** b
//  # Floor division (integer division): a // b
```
## 2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Used to compare values and return a Boolean result.
```
==  # Equal to: a == b
!=  # Not equal to: a != b
>   # Greater than: a > b
<   # Less than: a < b
>=  # Greater than or equal to: a >= b
<=  # Less than or equal to: a <= b
```

## 3. Assignment Operators
- Used to assign values to variables.
```
=   # Assign: a = b
+=  # Add and assign: a += b (equivalent to a = a + b)
-=  # Subtract and assign: a -= b
*=  # Multiply and assign: a *= b
/=  # Divide and assign: a /= b
%=  # Modulus and assign: a %= b
//= # Floor divide and assign: a //= b
**= # Exponent and assign: a **= b
&=  # Bitwise AND and assign: a &= b
|=  # Bitwise OR and assign: a |= b
^=  # Bitwise XOR and assign: a ^= b
>>= # Bitwise right shift and assign: a >>= b
<<= # Bitwise left shift and assign: a <<= b
```

## 4. Logical Operators
- Used to combine conditional statements.
```
and # Logical AND: a and b (True if both a and b are True)
or  # Logical OR: a or b (True if either a or b is True)
not # Logical NOT: not a (True if a is False)
```
## 5. Bitwise Operators
- Operate on binary representations of integers.
```
&   # Bitwise AND: a & b
|   # Bitwise OR: a | b
^   # Bitwise XOR: a ^ b
~   # Bitwise NOT: ~a
<<  # Bitwise left shift: a << b
>>  # Bitwise right shift: a >> b
```

## 6. Membership Operators
- Check for membership in sequences (like lists, strings, tuples).
```
in     # True if a value is in the sequence: a in b
not in # True if a value is not in the sequence: a not in b
```
## 7. Identity Operators
- Check whether two variables refer to the same object in memory.
```
is     # True if a and b refer to the same object: a is b
is not # True if a and b do not refer to the same object: a is not b
```
## 8. Special Operators
- Ternary (Conditional) Operator
- Used for conditional expressions.
```
a if condition else b  # Returns a if condition is True, otherwise b
```
## Operator Precedence
- Controls the order of operations in an expression.
- Parentheses `()` can be used to override precedence.
